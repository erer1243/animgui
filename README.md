# animgui
Simple 3D model viewer using glium + imgui. Basic linear and maybe more
interesting tweening based animation was planned, and some of it partially
implemented, but it was never finished.

Basic features are loading any obj file, and being able to view it with the
keyboard+mouse controlled camera position. Or, at least view it as well as
you can with the rainbow shader, ha ha.
